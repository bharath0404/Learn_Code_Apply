# LEARN - CODE - EXPERIMENT  

---

***Objective***: This is my personal repository to create AI/Robotics related code projects. It helps me to stay focused on concentrating my efforts on developing challenging projects. Also, this helps me develop new skills sets that would be very essential in the long run.     


## Table of Contents:  

1. Computer Vision (*OpenCV*)  
2. Deep Learning (*Keras and Tensorflow*)  
3. Robotics (*ROS and Theoretical concepts*)  
4. Microcontrollers (*Raspberry Pi and Arduino*)  

> This README will be continuously updated based on regular developments.
